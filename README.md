# Student Information System
*Merhaba, eğitim kurumlarının ihtiyacı olan bir mobil uygulama geliştirdim. Bu uygulama kullanım amacı öğrencilerin kendi ders programı , notları ve dönem ortalaması ve öğretmenlerin, kendi öğrencilerini, derslerini ve onlara verilecek sınav notlarını yönetmesi olacaktır.
